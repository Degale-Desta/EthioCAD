# EthioCAD
The EthioCAD dataset features three main domains and 18 classes, derived from 21+ videos spanning 5 minutes to 2 hours and 8 minutes, covering 18 activities. Frames were extracted at 1-12 second intervals in the Roboflow environment to optimize frame rate. Saved in the cloud for annotation, each image totals 4,224 KB.

We identified eighteen distinct subclasses or labels from the listed activities for our study. To collect the required data, we recorded these activities individually or in groups using surveillance systems installed in various smart classrooms and VDI rooms across the university. The recording process spanned three weeks in January 2024, with attention given to factors such as good lighting conditions, the arrangement of classroom objects, and voluntary participation from students and teachers. However, constraints such as environmental and weather conditions were noted. Additionally, a small portion of the dataset was sourced from YouTube videos, primarily created by TikTok users within our country.

Once the video recordings were completed, we stored them in organized directories on a local machine. Necessary adjustments, such as splitting and removing unwanted video segments, were performed to refine the data. The refined datasets were then arranged systematically with proper file naming conventions to facilitate subsequent processes. These raw datasets served as input for the next stage of data preparation, where selecting appropriate tools and adapting the environment was critical. 

**# Dataset Labeling and Naming Conventions**

Labeling mean assigning the names or some form of naming convention for the observed dataset during frame extraction or image annotation. As we descried EthioCAD datasets categories earlier, we applied the labeling approach for each and every individual image with respect to their activity descriptions. We have assigned eighteen class labels for all activity descriptions that can be assisted by experts or professionals. To simplify the aforementioned task based on annotator perspectives that provide them to be flexible and adapt the labeling concept in his or her way. Hence, to perform the desired tasks easily we applied some of the naming conventions and these can be defined as follows.
❖	“Group_discussion”: it is linguistically equivalent to group discussion which can be performed by a group of students to share their knowledges for a given topics during teaching learning session.
❖	“Raising_hand”: it is linguistically equivalent to raising hand which can be performed by a single student or group of students try to raising hands to answer or ask something during teaching learning session.
❖	Sitting: it is a normal occasional activity of students which enable them to sit or arrange the comfort zone for their learning capabilities in a classroom.
❖	“Using_Mobile_Phone”: it is linguistically equivalent to using mobile phone which can be performed by a single student or group of students which enable them to access information or enjoy their time during teaching learning session.
❖	“Explaining_the_Subject”: it is linguistically equivalent to explaining the subject which can be performed by a course instructor or teacher which enable him to interact with students during teaching learning session.
❖	Speaking: it is a normal occasional activity of students which enable them to talk something directly with teachers during teaching or learning session in the classroom.
❖	“Abnormal_Exam_Activity”: it is linguistically equivalent to abnormal exam activity which can be performed by a single /group of students or teacher which enable them to misbehave or try to violate the safe exam environment or rule of examination during written examination or assessment in the classroom.
❖	Reading: it is a normal occasional activity of students or teachers which enable them to understand something from teaching or learning resources.
❖	“Writing_on_the_board_or_Screen”: it is linguistically equivalent to writing on the board or screen which can be performed by a course teacher and enables his/her to write teaching materials in the board or screen during teaching learning session.
❖	Listening: it is a normal occasional activity of students or teachers which enable them to hear something from teacher or students during teaching or learning session.
❖	“Arriving_or_Leaving”: it is linguistically equivalent to arriving or leaving from or to the classroom which can be performed by a single/ group of students or teacher during teaching learning session or examination session.
❖	“Turning_Head_to_Talk”: it is linguistically equivalent to turning head to talk which can be performed by a single/ group of students and enable them to share something or talk each other during teaching learning session.
❖	Writing: it is a normal occasional activity of students which enable them to record teaching materials or knowledge on their teaching aids like notebooks and others during teaching or learning session.
❖	“Invigilation_Duties”: it is linguistically equivalent to invigilation duties which can be performed by a teacher and enables him to assist or manage examination activities.
❖	Standing: it is a normal occasional activity of students or teachers which enables them to erect their physical body correctly during teaching or learning session.
❖	Walking: it is a normal occasional activity of students or teachers which enable them try to move or relax their physical bodies during teaching or learning session.
❖	“Looking_Around”: it is linguistically equivalent to looking around which can be performed by a teacher or student (s) and enables them to investigate something from their environments.
