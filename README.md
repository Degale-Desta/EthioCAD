# EthioCAD
The EthioCAD dataset features three main domains and 18 classes, derived from 21+ videos spanning 5 minutes to 2 hours and 8 minutes, covering 18 activities. Frames were extracted at 1-12 second intervals in the Roboflow environment to optimize frame rate. Saved in the cloud for annotation, each image totals 4,224 KB.

We identified eighteen distinct subclasses or labels from the listed activities for our study. To collect the required data, we recorded these activities individually or in groups using surveillance systems installed in various smart classrooms and VDI rooms across the university. The recording process spanned three weeks in January 2024, with attention given to factors such as good lighting conditions, the arrangement of classroom objects, and voluntary participation from students and teachers. However, constraints such as environmental and weather conditions were noted. Additionally, a small portion of the dataset was sourced from YouTube videos, primarily created by TikTok users within our country.

Once the video recordings were completed, we stored them in organized directories on a local machine. Necessary adjustments, such as splitting and removing unwanted video segments, were performed to refine the data. The refined datasets were then arranged systematically with proper file naming conventions to facilitate subsequent processes. These raw datasets served as input for the next stage of data preparation, where selecting appropriate tools and adapting the environment was critical. Further details on these steps are discussed in the following section.
